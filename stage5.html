      <h2>Stage 5</h2>
        <p class="message">
            Your expedition has led you to an abandoned clock store with reversed signs everywhere. Following the guidance of the Jedi Master, you enter the passcode and enter. The jedi master then proclaims in his booming voice;

            “This is the end of your journey! You did well!”
            
            <br/>Despite being given the order to leave, ther natural curiosity that has served you well over the cosmic adventures instinctively makes you  to wander and explore the place.
            
            <br/>With playlists and old books littered all over the floor, broken book racks and lingering smell of dust, the room seems like a warehouse with an appearance barely  better than that of a junkyard. Your exploration leads you to check the scattered instruments and you come to the conclusion that you aren't in a simple rundown clock store like you had been told. You pick up a violin and reminisce about your younger years playing the instrument. You try to play it but quickly realize it's out off tune, much too high pitched... almost 4 semitones too high your well trained ears tell you. Also something strange seems to happen- The sound travels far too fast to your ears, then you conclude it must be due to the high density of the local atmosphere. Then You pick up the broken MP3 player and an absurd distorted audio file plays through the weathered speakers of the device. 
            
            <br/>After that, a ragged old book catches your attention, you squint close and it turns out to be a specific journal dating to 1971. You are about to look away, when you notice another book, a recipe book for Lettuce Green-chilli and Mayo.
            
            <br/>All of these send you into a deep thought and a sudden realization hits!
            </p>
