      <h2>Stage 4</h2>
        <p class="message">
            Following Luke Skywalker’s trail, you find yourself across the universe in the constellation of Cassiopea. Having made your way all through the empty chasm of cosmos, from the enemy base to a new world, A barren skyless world locked in a divine dance with one of the stars of the constellation !<br/>

            Red rocks sweep behind as you speed through the barren landscape, ambitiously pursuing a specific spacecraft. Finally, a few meters ahead your desired altar appears before you! The white altar shines just like condensed starshine and on top of it, glimmers the amethyst gemstone. You make a run for the treasure. <br/>
            
            The moment it contacts your hand, the atmosphere tightens and a gust of wind blows just beneath your ear like a ticklish whisper. Blinding light emanates from the gemstone. You cover your eyes, to shield from its intensity.<br/>
            
            “What brings you here, young Voyager?” an eerily archaic but soothing voice says.<br/>
            
            Before you, stands the condensed moonshine in the form of a woman, as old as time.<br/>
            
            Your eyes widen, it takes you a second before regaining composure.<br/>
            
            You brief her about your manhunt, to which she smiles kindly and chants her knowledge in an incomprehensible language.<br/> Can you decipher her words and figure out Luke Skywalker’s whereabouts?<br/>
            
            The woman says: "ANEB LACK HOLERN OITA IDTOF CONCD ETAR"<br/>
            
            You look on, confused, and check your beeping watch to see a heat signature approaching rapidly from the bottom left of the screen.<br/>It must be the forces of the Empire.<br/> There seemed to be 8 units… This was not good! Then the second radar sweep happened, THERE WERE 4 WAVES OF THEM!! You quickly run to seek shelter as you ponder upon her words, losing yourself in the regular clockwise sweeping motions of the radar scanner. The route ahead does not seem quite clear.
