                <p class="mb-04">
                  Welcome, intrepid adventurers! The Rebellion needs your help in its fight against the wicked Empire. We have intercepted a series of transmissions from our enemies - each of these transmissions is a puzzle that needs to be solved with a keyword. If you guess the correct keywords, we can use them to decipher future Imperial transmissions and save innocent lives. This is our most desperate hour. Help us - you are our only hope.<br>
                    1.  You are on a quest to help the Rebellion! Your adventure will start with round 1 of Galactrix at 00:01 on 27th October 2023, and will end on 29th October, at 23:59. <br>
                    2.  Fight solo or team up with up to 3 people in this cosmic crypt-hunt. Remember - you can only be a part of one team at a time! The event is open to everyone across the globe!<br>
                    3.  Be sure to join our<a class="discord" href="https://discord.gg/q2K75gd9Vp"> discord channel</a> to communicate with the moderators and ask for clues.<br>
                    4.  Decrypt your way through 5 stages of increasing difficulty in round 1. You must enter the correct key to move on to the next puzzle. <span class="rules">You will get 5 tries per question to enter the correct key word, after which you will be locked out.</span><br>
                    5.  Remember - the keyword will always be entirely in lowercase alphanumeric characters, with no spaces. If the answers you come up with have spaces or punctuation, omit them when entering your answer.<br>
                        Example: “American.Pie!” becomes “americanpie” when you enter the answer.<br>
                    6.  You are free to use any resource available to you to help with your quest, including Google and ChatGPT.<br>
                    7.  Beware of the time, because you are racing with all the other teams - the first ten teams to complete round 1 will gain free entry into round 2 of the challenge, which will be conducted during ATMOS ‘23. These top ten teams must compete in Atmos with the same members.<br>
                    8.  In case less than ten teams complete round 1, points shall be allotted based on the number of rounds a team has completed and the amount of time they have taken.<br>
                    9.  Teams who fail to qualify in Round 1 can still participate in Round 2 during ATMOS'23 by paying an entry fee.<br>
                    10. Any attempt to access levels you have not yet reached or any form of attack on the servers will result in instant disqualification.<br>
                    11. The organizer's decision is final in any and all cases.<br>
                    12. The Rebellion will reward you handsomely in the event that you succeed in the final adventure! 
                        The first three teams to succeed in their quests will win prizes from a pool of Rs. 15,000.<br>

                </p>
                <h2 class="mb-0">Some Important Tips to remember</h2>
                <p>
                   1. Reverse searching images might help you in certain cases.<br>
                   2. The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong train of thought.<br>
                   3. On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and other such variations.<br>
                   4. Hints to the questions will be released on discord at the moderator’s discretion.<br>
                   5. The discord channel is the quickest way to reach the moderators of Galactrix. You may ask for hints on the forum.
